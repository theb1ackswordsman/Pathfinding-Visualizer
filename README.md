# Pathfinding-Visualizer
An interactive, browser-based visualizer built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate the step-by-step execution of fundamental pathfinding algorithms. This project was developed as part of the Summer Pre-Placement Education Program (PEP) at Lovely Professional University.
The visualizer provides a clear, graphical representation of how different algorithms explore a grid to find the shortest path between two points. Users can place obstacles, generate random mazes, and observe the unique exploration patterns of each algorithm in real-time.

Features
Algorithm Implementations: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A* Search Algorithm.

Interactive Grid: A 20x30 grid that allows users to place and remove walls (obstacles).

Maze Generation: Random maze generation for testing algorithm performance under different scenarios.

Visual Execution: Color-coded visualization showing visited nodes, the frontier, and the final path.

Performance Metrics: Real-time display of time complexity, space used, and actual runtime for each algorithm.

Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.

Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

No External Dependencies: Implemented using vanilla JavaScript for optimal performance and educational clarity.

This project serves as an excellent educational tool for students and developers to understand the inner workings, efficiency, and practical applications of pathfinding algorithms in AI, game development, and robotics.
